Informations :
- Fortement inspiré par les jeux Soulsborne de FromSoft, mais seuls certains noms, phrases courtes et concepts pour les capacités sont repris directement de ces jeux.

- Les tables de capacités pour ces kits sont créées au moment de l'installation. Chaque kit clone la table de la classe de base (si elle existe). Cela signifie que toute modification de classe installée au préalable sera incluse dans les kits du mod.

- Si des sorts ont été modifiés, alors ils seront appris par certains kits. Par exemple, le kit de l'Exécuteur acquiert normalement Cécité comme un sort de prêtre de niveau 1. Si vous avez installé Spell Revisions au préalable, il obtiendra à la place Obscuring Mist (Brouillard Obscurcissant).

- Ce mod est compatible avec BG:EE, BG2:EE, IWD:EE et EET. Mon intention initiale était de le rendre également compatible avec BG2 classique, mais il est probablement trop tard pour cela. Ce mod fait un usage massif des opcodes exclusifs aux Enhanced Editions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Création d'insignes de chasseur (amulettes) :

- Certains kits bénéficieront d'une capacité leur permettant de fabriquer un insigne de chasseur, à partir d'un certain niveau.
- Ces capacités ne pourront être acquises que si un Chasseur fait partie du groupe.

REMARQUE : les Chasseurs ne gagnent pas la capacité Création d'une insigne de chasseur, mais ils peuvent néanmoins en acheter.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compatibilité :

Instructions générales :

- Installer après Rogue Rebalancing. Plusieurs fichiers de RR doivent être patchés pour une compatibilité totale.
- Installez après les mods qui modifient les classes, à moins qu'il ne soit spécifiquement indiqué d'installer après n'importe quel kit.
- Installer après les mods qui modifient ou écrasent les sorts.
- Installer après les mods qui ajoutent de nouvelles armes ou armures.
- Installer avant les mods qui révisent les compétences martiales.

NOTE : En général, je recommande d'installer ce mod après les autres kits, à l'exception de Talents of Faerun et des mods dédiés aux multiclasses. Techniquement, ce mod peut être installé en toute sécurité même après la plupart des mods de tweak, mais c'est toujours une bonne idée de suivre les directives d'installation habituelles, qui font passer les kits avant les tweaks.

Les systèmes de lancement de sorts :

- Compatible avec le système de sphères de Faiths and Powers. Ils peuvent être installé avant ou après.
	- Mes kits multi-classes ne nécessitent pas le mod FnP multiclass pour être compatibles avec Faiths and Powers.
	- Voir les informations ci-dessous.
- Compatible avec le système de sphères de Deities of Faerun. Installez ce mod après DoF.
- Compatible avec le mod 5E_spellcasting de subtledoctor. Peut être installé avant ou après.
	- Installer The Workshop Kitpack avant le mod 5E_spellcasting.
	- Mais vous devez toujours installer le composant supplémentaire lié au mod 5E_spellcasting.

--

Note sur le mod Talents of Faerun : 
	- Les composants de sorts peuvent être installés avant ou après The Workshop Kitpack, je recommande de les installer avant(en particulier les sorts d'IWD).
	- Les composants liés aux races peuvent être installés avant ou après The Workshop Kitpack.
	- Les composants qui tweak les kits devraient être installés après The Workshop Kitpack (Certains peuvent être installés avant, mais ils sont souvent tous mélangés, il est donc plus simple de tout installer après.)
- The divine casting kits have full support for custom spheres. Must be installed before the cleric revisions.
- All kits need to be before anything that touches the proficiency or HLA screens (or buttons might not work).

NOTE: This was asked about, so I'll mention that ToF Evasion can be installed before or after this mod. Kits that gain Evasion will gain it whether installed before or after. Spells/abilities that allow an Evasion check will only do so if Evasion is already in the game. If you want to install Evasion before this mod, consider using the IWDification version instead.

--

OlvynSpells notes:
- Spell tweaks can be installed before or after this mod. I'd recommend to install them before.
- Paladin/Ranger components can be installed before or after. Note that these need to be installed after most other kit mods.
- New spells can be installed before or after. Note that these need to be installed after most other kit mods (OlvynSpells adds spells directly to the kit tables for some classes).
- Untested with 3e metamagic component. To be safe, install it after this mod.

--

Capacités de haut niveau (HLA) Pièges et Chants du barde :

- Rogue Rebalancing: Powder Keg is compatible with the RR HLA song (including Lingering song). Requires patching the RR songs, so this mod needs to be installed after RR.
- Shohy's bard song mod: The HLA song from Shohy's mod by default gives an ability to switch to it. This mod will patch that ability for better compat with Powder Keg songs (remove delayed effects). Install after Shohy's mod for best compatibility.
- Bardic Wonders: Powder Keg will gain Bardic Inspiration at level 1 if installed after that component. If installed after the Bard Song Mechanics tweak, a line will be added to the "Change Song" ability for the HLA song, describing the tweak effects.
- Talents of Faerun: Powder Keg can take the HLA song, but the special ability (to switch songs) will change to the vanilla HLA song. This mod should be installed before the ToF HLA component (or buttons might not work).
- Untested with other bard revisions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Information supplémentaire pour FnP :

NOTE : Les kits de Clerc multiclassés ne sont actuellement pas compatible avec la version beta de FnP. Utilisez la version v0.84.5 si vous voulez utiliser ces kits avec Faiths and Powers. 

FnP multiclass :
- La version actuelle de FnP multiclass masque la classe G/M/C (Guerrier / Mage / Clerc) de l'écran de sélection à la création du personnage. 
- Il est possible que le mod FnP multiclass soit mis à jour pour ne pas désactiver la Multi-classe (Guerrier / Mage / Clerc), mais pour l'instant, il existe quelques moyens de contourner ce problème :
1. Installez ce mod après FnP multiclass. Il la réactivera automatiquement.
2. Utilisez cdtweaks/Tweaks Anthology. Il contient des composants qui permettent à toutes les classes (y compris FMC) d'être disponibles pour toutes les races.
3. Éditez le fichier clsrcreq.2DA. Trouvez juste FIGHTER_MAGE_CLERIC, et mettez les races que vous voulez à la valeur 1.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version info:

v5.18
- Medic: Fixed possible bug. If casting speed was slowed by a spell or item, and current Ki Energy was insuffucient for an ability, it would show the "Not enough Ki Energy" message but the effects would still be applied, and no Ki Energy would be used. Adjusted some timings to fix the issue.
- Minor reorganizing of Ki Energy files. Some files are renamed and moved apart from the Medic files. This will break compatibility with Medics made before this version, but this can be fixed. If Ki Energy system is broken, import and equip the item "d2kifix.itm". This will remove the problematic effects.
- War Magician: Reverted Twisted Barricade change from last update (now cast normally again). Unleash Magic is still cast as a free action.
- Any of the buffs/explosions that dispel web/entangle/grease status now also remove insects status (not mentioned in descriptions).
- ToF mod: the updater now runs an Enrage-related file to avoid compatibility issues with my other kit mod (d2mk).


v5.17
- War Magician: Unleash Magic and Twisted Barricade are now used as free actions. This means you can cast another spell without waiting a round. (notes: These will still trigger wild magic zones. They can be used while paused but effects aren't given until game is unpaused.)
- Nurse: N-Alchemy is now used as a free action. Same as above except it doesn't trigger wild magic. The actual nurse abilities are cast normally.
- Fixed Kit Updater patching wrong Starjammer spell resources if the spell.ids config option was used during the initial mod install.
- Blood Minister: Fixed usability if installed before Faiths & Powers. Run the Kit Updater to fix. (note: It's still recommended to install after FnP, except the multiclasses).
- Fixed Nurse N-Alchemy abilities not being removed on death/revival or export/import. Previously, if you died or exported while abilities were still active, they were learned permanently until the next time you used N-Alchemy.
- Fixed a display issue with N-Alchemy and Bubb's Menu Overlay mode (affected single class Nurse). After a full Rest, if you still had 2-3 Alchemy Points, abilities weren't properly removed from the Overlay (you had to change screens or click another character to fix it).
- Powder Keg: Fixed visual glitch with Dust Explosion where the character would briefly have full visual range after moving.
- Crow Hunter: This is just a technical change. The "haste" from Visceral Attack now gives +1 APR and movement bonus, instead of using the normal haste effect (similar to Offensive Spin). Magical haste (i.e. from Moonlight Knight or Hunter Bone) still uses the haste opcode.
- OlvynSpells (v2.6.0) notes: Improved compat with 3e metamagic component and EEex effects from new spells component. This mod can be installed before or after any components of OlvynSpells. If installed before new spells or 3e metamagic, run the Kit Updater after to check EEex effects.
- Fixed possible installer error with Drifter kit (mod compat related).
- These abilities now do 1 second hit stun: Booming Song, Visceral Attack, Steady Current, Electrocannon, Moonlight Vortex, Dragonrot, and Ether Explosion. This is not mentioned in the descriptions.
- Powder Keg: Improved effects structure for learning song from Etherbomb Songbook. No longer uses a kit-targeted effect. Instead, the mod adds a song book unlocker (d2usb.spl). If gained by a kit, using songbooks from this mod will change the current bard song. (Etherbomb Songbook is the only one currently, but there will possibly be 1-2 more)
- Improved effects structure for Flynn's Ring buff. Repeating armor check is now unaffected by slow/haste (still checked every 3 seconds). Buff is also now removed within 1 second if ring is unequipped.

v5.16
- ToF notes: All cleric single/multiclass kits now have correct HLA lists based on spheres. Nurse can take any potion ability. Forgot to give Spell Fencer an Arcane Knowledge feat. (note: Triple class HLAs might be buggy, this is a ToF issue.)
- Confessor: Kit Updater now removes Cure Disease if a later tweak adds it for paladins (ex. ToF revisions). This follows IWD rules, where kits that don't gain Lay On Hands also don't gain Cure Disease.
- Patching for subtledoctor's 5e casting mod is now part of the Kit Updater, replacing the old component. Run it any time after 5e casting to make changes. If you later uninstall 5e casting, re-run the updater to revert changes.
- Kit Updater can now change spell cap, holy symbols, and extra hunter badges config settings.
- Using the updater now ends the current weidu run (i.e. skips the the normal installer options).
- Misc items now has subcomponent "Dev mode (start with Item Sack)".
- Reverted Warhound change from last update (no longer immune to own explosive shots).
- Slightly increased Warhound Shockwave damage (now does 3 + 2d4 per 4 levels up to 3 + 10d4). Average damage starts at 8 and scales to 28 + guaranteed knockback with no save.

v5.15
- Kit Updater can now be used to change some of the misc options in the Config.ini.
- Tracking ability: If rangers can gain this at level 1, then kits that could gain Tracking as an HLA (Confessor, Crow Hunter) will also gain it at level 1. The updater will also check for this.
- Added color glows for Moonlight Knight's Torrent effects. Different colors for higher versions.
- Nurse's Autoimmune: When/if statuses are cured, it now also heals 30% of maximum Hit Points.
- Crow Hunter's Visceral Attack: Healing changed from 12 HP to 5 + 20% of max HP. (for comparison, in the v1.0 this healed 20 HP.)
- Beast Hunter: Added some minor additional bonuses at levels 8 and 16.
- Warhounds now take no damage from their own Shockwave or Incinerate. It still removes grease/entangle effects if the caster is hit by the blast/flames.
- Fixed a minor issue with Powder Keg kit and Talents of Faerun HLA component. If taking the ToF HLA song it now switches to the correct song. Run the Kit Updater after ToF to apply fix.
- Powder Keg: Fixed a loophole that let you use powder keg explosions every round. Also, scripted singing can no longer bypass the cooldown timer.
- Nurse: Changed armor restriction to leather and hide, instead of just leather. Gives the single class more options.

v5.14
- Kit Updater note: More work on proficiency updates. The main new thing is that each time this is run now, it will first copy paste every value from the base class over to the kit. Then it makes further edits for kits that need it. This means that for values not specifically edited, it will always be identical to the base class after running the updater.
- Medic: The HLA list now checks for some fist only HLAs added by mods (ToF, Artisan's Kitpack). If detected, the kit will not gain the equivalent fighter hlas. (my monk kits add some fighter hlas not in the base monk table)
- Powder Keg: Will now always have damage HLA traps, even if removed from bards by a tweak.
- Icons: for kits with multiple abilities, icons should now always have the same visual style if using a mod that changes icons (ex. Remastered Spell Icons). An exception is the Medic Arts ability (the submenu uses the actual Poison Weapon and Lay On Hands abilities).
- subtledoctor's Combat Skills mod: A few adjustments. Some kits can put more in Dodge or Ranged skills. Crow Hunter can no longer take traps. This is done from both the main component and the updater, but it's recommended to install before Combat Skills, then run the updater after.
- Skills & Abilities mod: Some kits will no longer have the "Heavy Armor" proficiency. This is done from both the main component and the updater, but it's recommended to install before Skills & Abilities, then run the updater after.

v5.13
- Talents of Faerun notes:
	- Misc improvements to minor/high level abilities lists. Run the Kit Updater after ToF to implement changes.
	- Several kits can no longer learn feats related to their kit disadvantages.
	- Several kits have extra options that aren't normally part of their class. (ex. all archer kits can take any ranged combat feat/HLA, Medic can take Poison Weapon upgrades, etc.)
	- BG2EE: All arcane kits (including multiclasses) will have 1 of the Arcane Knowledge feats taken for free. The feat is denoted at level 1, but effects aren't given until level 18 mage. (These are required for selecting HLA spells of a school.)
	- Note: If ToF feats/HLAs are detected in the override, the Kit Updater patches the m_dw_hld.lua file, and backs up an unmodified version in weidu_external\d2wk. The updater only needs to be run once, but is safe to run repeatedly (it won't create duplicate lines).
- Kit Updater: Added option to restore backup ToF lua file before edits. This isn't normally needed. The updater won't add duplicate lines. If you see a feat/HLA that is permanently grayed out, you can try using this. (note: this won't fix possible issues with cleric sphere system HLAs)

v5.12
- Kit Updater: Various improvements. Adjusted mod compat stuff.
- Nurse: There's no description update, but ranged proficiencies are now always (base thief + 1). It will still be 2 slots max in most cases. The updater component will also recheck this. Also, the number will never be lowered from the current amount (i.e. if a mod gave it Mastery or higher).
- Temple Knight: No changes, but installer/updater now won't lower blunt/polearm proficiencies if you installed a tweak that gives all paladins grand mastery.
- multiclass clerics: Updater now won't lower proficiency numbers if you installed a tweak that gives multiclass warriors higher than 2 slots in weapons.
- Faiths & Powers note: Expanded HLA lists for Blood Minister and cleric multiclasses. Two things to note. (1) Not all HLAs will match the kit's sphere list. They were chosen based on what I thought looked right for the kit. (2) HLAs are added by scanning FnP kits and copy pasting lines to this mod's HLA tables. (i.e. you need to install FnP clerics/druids/shamans for the full HLA lists)
- FnP note 2: If you use FnP spheres, but don't want to install some or all FnP kits, that's fine too. Kits will just have a smaller HLA list. Note that the Blood Minister will (as of this update) always have anything from the shaman HLA list.
- A few kits can now learn an extra HLA from another class (ex. Grave Warden can take UAI).

v5.11
- Added new component: Kit Updater. This replaces the "Update Medic Arts" component. Can be re-run at any time. Skipped on initial mod install. This is safe to install at end of order, including after mods that say they need to be installed last. Currently, it does the Medic updates, and also remakes HLA tables. It also rechecks proficiencies for kits different from the base class.
- Kits with armor restrictions are now listed in the "Unusable" part of the item description.
- HLA tables for all kits now have unique resource names. These are clones of the base class table, including any tweaks or additions. Running the Kit Updater will also remake all HLA tables.
- Warrior HLAs: Paladin, ranger, and monk kits now scan the base fighter HLA list and copy paste any lines they don't already have (except Resist Magic for monks). There won't be anything added in the unmodded game, but with mods there might be.
- Multiclass HLAs: Multiclass kits now check the base single class for missing abilities (can happen with ToF, depending on game/components). Triple class kits won't check the Mage list, but will have anything from the base triple class (i.e. if modded to have HLA spells).

v5.10
- Starjammer: Gemini Swap now does the teleport instantly (previously delayed 1 second). Also briefly invisible (both caster and target).
- Nurse kit's Autoimmune triggers faster (always within 1-2 seconds now).
- All support abilities that target a single creature are now castable on invisible or sanctuaried allies. This was already the case for some but not all. Can optionally make them not castable on invisible from config.ini.
- Compatibility note: This mod is now safe to install before or after most proficiency overhauls (tested with cdtweaks, skills & abilities). Talents of Faerun weapon system still needs to be after, but most others should be fine before or after.
- Cleric multiclasses: the config option to have more proficiency choices is now always auto-enabled if the base multiclass has expanded usability. Previously, it would only check specifically for the FnP or DoF mods.
- Blood Minister: Previously already had expanded proficiency options if FnP or DoF tweaks were detected. This now checks the base cleric class directly, instead of specific mods.
- Blood Minister: "No gauntlets or bracers" restriction is now specifically for magic items. (This was mainly done to test a new install file, but might as well leave it in.)

v5.9
- Bubb's Spell Menu note: Fixed display issues in Overlay mode with Ki Energy (Medic kit). It should now always display the correct amount of Ki Energy after using an ability. (This was just a display issue. The actual Ki Energy amount was always correct.)
- Multiclass kits should no longer randomly regain all daily uses of abilities. This only happened rarely. It was a side effect of a workaround for a possible export/import issue (still implemented, but improved effects structure).
- Fixed patching issue when installed after EE Fixpack (only affected Medic's Spiritual Clarity).
- Starjammer: Now briefly invisible when using Riftstep (cancels spells against, unless caster sees through invisibility).
- Powder Keg songs will now break invisibility. If Improved Invisible, will still keep the other effects. Previously you could just stand around invisible until enemies were dead, unless they could see through invisibility.
- Moonlight Knight: Moonlight Vortex has a bigger beam visual and hits in a wider area (kind of). The actual beam itself is still a narrow line, but it does some stuff to approximate a wider area.
- Warhound explosions and Powder Keg's fiery explosions now dispel effects of webs, grease, and entangle on allies in the area (even if they don't take damage). Also protected for 5 seconds (enough time to leave the area). A couple kit abilities may do something similar.
- Other minor changes (sound effects, BAM images, text colors, etc.).

v5.8
- Updated French translation from JohnBob.
- Fixed issue where poison cures were also removing the assassin Poison Weapon buff.
- Medic: Dragonrot damage should no longer cause frozen death (or at least super low chance). Damage is now split between cold and acid, instead of all cold. (note: this ignores damage resistance, cold is used because I like the visual/sound)
- Blood Minister: Lead Elixir now increments resists, instead of setting them.
- Powder Keg: Fire resist now starts at 10% and scales with level up to 50%.
- Compat update (Talents of Faerun): For IWDEE, all healing spells from this mod can now heal any of the new PC races added by ToF. Restrictions for other races may still apply (depends on spell). These restrictions should normally only apply to summons.
- Changes to BAM images for item descriptions. Should look better with UI overhaul mods (ex. Infinity UI++).

v5.7
- Updates:
	- Medic: Ki Power is now called Ki Energy. Healing Rain now heals 10 + 15% of max HP each round. Dragonrot damage changed to 8 + 5% of max HP damage per round. Medic's Spiritual Clarity now also breaks curses. Text changes.
	- Added extra component to update description of Medic Arts ability. This component is only relevant if Poison Weapon or Lay On Hands were changed after installing this mod (ex. with ToF). This component can be re-run at any time (does not uninstall other mods).
	- ToB: if starting new game, Beast Hunter and Confessor now start with Leather Armor, so they can wear it.
- Compatibility notes:
	- Powder Keg: fixed minor issue when installed after IWDification (was gaining 2 HLA song abilities).
	- Medic: fix compat issue with Artisan's Kitpack (related to Poison Weapon changes). This mod must be installed after Artisan's kitpack for fix to be applied (it needs to know which resource is the correct Poison Weapon before install).
	- Blood Minister: weapon restrictions (for FnP or DoF mods) will no longer include any item that is usable by all classes, races, alignments, regardless of weapon type.
	- Talents of Faerun: Fixed possible installer warning if installed after class revisions section. Not recommending to install after, I just did it as an experiment. Most kits will probably work fine installed before or after (will account for class revisions either way). However, the divine casting kits need to be before the cleric revisions for custom spheres to work.
- Armor restrictions notes:
	- Loosened restrictions for dragonscale armors. Kits with restrictions can now wear a full step up for dragon type armors (ex. if restricted to chain or splint, can wear plate-style dragon scales). Class restrictions will still apply. For BG2EE and IWDEE, this will catch mod items installed before this mod if they have "Scale Armor" (39544 in dialog.tlk) as the unidentified name.
	- No longer restricts any armor that is usable by all classes, races, alignments, regardless of armor type. This is to account for possible mod items usable by anyone (for lore reasons, etc.).

v5.6
- Updates:
	- Powder Keg: song icons now have different colors. (config option to change back to old blue icons)
	- Medic: removed Config ability. This was used to turn on/off text feedback for ki regen (now always on).
	- Grave Warden: Denial no longer dispellable. Still affected by wild/dead magic.
	- Full Metal Jaguar: Critical Boost now gained at level 7. Backstab immunity gained at level 3.
	- War Magician: kit abilities no longer dispellable. Still affected by wild/dead magic.
	- Shaman Bone Blade: Charm duration changed back to 4 rounds, but charmed creature will not become hostile if attacked or hit with an aoe. Also, the charm no longer makes neutral NPCs hostile after wearing off (changed to match berserk, which doesn't make hostile).
	- ToB: changed starting bags for some kits if "misc items" component is installed.
- Compatibility notes:
	- Improved Archer(argent77): archer kits (anything with +hit with ranged) can now take Sure Shot or Missile Trap as HLAs. This mod should be installed after Improved Archer.
	- Artisan's Kitpack: fixed Moonlight Knight issue when installed after ranger revision (was gaining Set Snares, but couldn't use it due to having 0 Set Traps). Now gains the proper skill points from the revision. A couple other minor tweaks.
	- fix for cleric/ranger (Artisan's Kitpack): ranger revision currently gives the c/r multiclass Set Snares, but no skill points in Set Traps. Workshop Kitpack now assigns changes to ranger skills to the base c/r multiclass. This is done by default, so it should cover any revision installed before this mod.

v5.5
- Blood Minister: tweaked blood effects. Removed portrait icons for status immunities.
- Starjammer: Improved effects structure for Riftgate and Riftstep.
- Grave Warden: Removed portrait icons for status immunities.
- Cosmic Watcher Badge: Changed equipped effects. Added visual feedback for level drain if save failed.
- Confessor: no longer gains paladin Cure Disease if detected before install (extra line is also added to kit description). This will catch mods that add Cure Disease to BGEE/BG2EE, as long as installed the proper way (with spell.ids entry).
- more work done on various functions or prep files (cumulative work over all the v5.x).
- compatibility: tested v5.x changes with SR, SR-Revised, MiH mods, EE fixpack, and a few others.

v5.4
- Updates:
	- Powder Keg: Song switching now usable while paused and ignores spell delays.
	- Medic: Added a "Medic Config" ability. Lets you turn on/off feedback messages for ki power (default is ON). Can also remove the ability from current playthrough.
	- Nurse: Fixed minor issue with Overdose ability in IWDEE (was giving a movement bonus).
- Compatibility notes:
	- Rogue Rebalancing: fixed installer warnings when installed after rr HLA songs. Caused by a recent change that I forgot to apply to rr patching.
	- Shohy's bard song mod: Fixed various issues when installed after Shohy's mod. Powder Keg can take the HLA song and gains an ability to switch to it (note: does not gain "chorus" abilities).
	- Bardic Wonders: Fixed install issue with the Blade revision. Caused the Nurse kit's Overdose ability to not install correctly (it's made by cloning and editing Offensive Spin).
	- Install this mod after the above mods for best compatibility (there is specific patching for each mod).

v5.3
- Medic: redesigned kit (see description). It's now based around a ki power system. Ki increases with level and regenerates +1 per 5 rounds. The old abilities are still there, but fit into the new system. See release post for more info.
- Starjammer: can now stop Riftgate summon from following party by itself (B key). This is also mentioned in the dialogue box when summoned.
- Moonlight Knight: higher versions of Torrent now have slightly different portrait icons.
- More colored strings. Strings are now colored with a custom function instead of directly in the TRA file.
- Bleed effects: now blocked by stoneskins and IWD Shield of Lathander (including similar mod spells). Damage from bleeding no longer wakes sleeping creatures.

v5.2
- Powder Keg: Visual adjustments. All status effect strings will now be blocked by immunity to the status (some were but some weren't).
- Warhound: Shockwave's knockback effect will now only affect enemies. The damage still hits anyone. If you prefer knocking away allies, the change can be reversed in the Config file.
- Grave Warden: Fear and gaze immunity now cover a few additional spells (ex. umber hulk gaze, IWD harpy wail).
- Drifter: Items with on-hit entangle/grease effects are now patched directly (this will catch any mod items installed before this mod).
- Shaman Bone Blade: Elf/half-elf can now resist both charm and berserk from this item. Charm duration increased to 8 rounds (berserk still at 4 rounds).
- More floating text. Changed some annoying sounds. Status effects more colorful (fade/pulse colors).

v5.0
- Kit/item changes:
	- Nurse: Major kit revision (see kit description). It's now based around a main ability called N-Alchemy. When N-Alchemy is used, it gives the character 3 "alchemy points" and a set of abilities to use. The old abilities are still there, but rebalanced for the N-Alchemy system.
	- Moonlight Knight: Revised/tweaked all kit abilities/passives (see kit description).
	- Noble Scion: adjusted Blood Bullet ability. The damage is now capped by the "spellcap" setting (config.ini). However, it now doubles the base kit bonus to ranged THAC0 (this is uncapped).
	- Crow Hunter: slightly adjusted Visceral Attack levels (now 9, 13, 17).
	- Temple Knight: Tweaked disadvantages. Bolt of Glory now gained at levels 9, 13, 17. Force now has reduced effects against larger sized creatures (stun 1 second).
	- Slightly expanded alignment options for thief/paladin kits.
	- Tweaked items: Milkweed (rune), Colorless Demon Soul
- Technical updates:
	- Medical Darts (Nurse): The character will now stop attacking when all darts are used (if AI is on, will retarget to an enemy). Also, any effects that target "allies" or "enemies" are now relative to caster. Also fixed a bug that could cause the darts to be removed before the duration ended.
	- Haste effects will now fully remove Slow spells (and vice versa). Spells with multiple statuses (ex. Holy Word, Dolorous Decay) will not have the non-Slow statuses removed.
	- The Grave Warden's Denial ability can now be recast on a target that already has the effect. Previously, it would give a message that the "contingency" could not be recast.
	- The Crow Hunter's Splintering Shot no longer bleeds enemies with 100+ piercing resist (this doesn't apply to the bleed from Confessor kit or Clawmark rune).
	- Drifter: A few more spells added to the "ground" and "cloud" immunity packages. Anything added fits the general theme for each immunity type (ex. insect spells for cloud).
- Other:
	- a few extra abilities are capped by the "spellcap" setting in config.ini (default 20 for BG games, 30 for IWDEE).
	- Added extra feedback messages (ex. Denial will say when it has activated and effects ended).
	- Changed a couple portrait icons. Adjusted colors of some icons/animations. Changed some sound effects.
	- Some pretty significant internal changes and improvements, on the installer side.
- Compatibility notes:
	- EE fixpack: Madman's Blood (Blood Minister) should no longer cancel itself out immediately. Any abilities that cure statuses will now also apply any relevant EEFP subspells. Updated list of EEFP immunity spellstates (some were missing).
	- SR-Revised: fixed installer warnings when installed after SRR.
	- Faiths and Powers: improved compatibility with paladin archetypes. For best compatibility, install this mod after the paladin components (and preferably after applying the sphere system).
	- Deities of Faerun: Moonlight Knight CR now gains minor access to Healing sphere (replacing Weave).
	- Talents of Faerun (beta 12): Added custom sphere support for all divine casting kits. For multiclass variants, any edits to kit descriptions will no longer be added to the single class (and vice versa). See release post for additional info.

v4.7.9
- French translation updated, thanks to JohnBob.
- Medic: Healing Rain now also removes fatigue.
- Temple Knight: Bolt of Glory no longer applies damage more than once to some creature types.
- Confessor: Blur no longer stacks with itself. Vampiric Touch no longer works on undead or golems.

v4.7.8
- Compatibility fix for EEex (v0.10.0-alpha and later):
	- Some kits had broken effects due to a change in recent EEex versions.
	- All kit abilities are fixed now. The affected kits were the ones with special amulet effects (i.e. Beast Hunter and hunter badges).
	- as a side effect: these item effects will now work even with custom multiclass kits.
- Crow Hunter updates:
	- Damage bonus vs. humans/humanoids now starts at +1, increases to +2 at level 5, and +3 at level 10. For multiclasses, it upgrades with thief level only (not average level of classes).
	- Multiclass variants will now gain Visceral attack at the correct levels (9, 13, and 18).
	- Visceral Attack is now more likely to roll in the upper range of the damage roll. This makes it a little better for mage/thief or single class.
	- Can now use any mod-added traps (i.e. Talents of Faerun HLAs), even if installed after this mod. Must be Thief level 14 or higher.
	- Bonus effect from the Crowfeather Cloak item will now work with custom multiclass kits.
- Other:
	- Beast Hunter: Added an extra effect for the Old Hunter Badge amulet. When using Hunter Tools, the character will never roll a critical miss (with melee attacks).
	- Jade Feather: This now gives a +8 bonus to max HP (basically an extra roll of HP for monks). This replaces the +3 bonus to Save vs. Spell.

v4.7.7
- Fixed a patching error, related to riftstep/riftgate creatures (some equipped effects on their weapons were also added as on-hit effects).
- Fixed a minor variable issue (prevented patching something with bleeding effects).
- Improved patching-related stuff (speed and method), while fixing above issues.
- Minor tweaking of a couple things from last update.

v4.7.6
- New projectiles for these spells: Force (Temple Knight), Electrocannon/Interference (Starjammer), Etherbomb Songbook.
- Powder Keg: for the cloud songs, if effects are decoupled by pausing/unpausing, allies/neutrals should no longer be affected by enemy-only effects (i.e. you can pause/unpause safely inside a Frenzying Flame).
- Starjammer: Riftgate summon now immune to wing buffet (knockback effects), but not to any damage caused by these spells/attacks. Other adjustments to riftstep/riftgate creatures (movement speed, add/remove immunities, etc.).
- Blood Minister: Improved effects structure of Blood Transfusion abilities. Will no longer work on undead, golems, or elementals. If cast on a non-ally, it will now display a string that the "recipient refused the Blood Transfusion", unless the target is naturally immune (will get the normal immunity message).
- Tweaked visuals/sounds for a few other abilities.

v4.7.5
- Powder Keg changes:
	- Reduced delay between each use of a song from 10 rounds to 8 rounds.
	- Blasting Song: Main blast now delayed 1 second (damage unchanged). A new lead-in projectile does an extra 2 fire damage to enemies in a 12-ft. radius. It's visually more interesting now, and the initial projectile lets you know when the main blast is coming.
	- Booming Song: Damage increased from 2d4 to 3d8. Tweaked explosion visual/sound.
	- Dust Explosion: Damage of initial blast increased from 5d6 to 8d6. Creatures immune to blind no longer suffer reduced visual range. Enemies now move at half speed in the cloud.
	- Frenzying Flame: Damage per round increased from 2d4 to 2d12.
- Medic changes:
	- at level 10, Slow Poison is now upgraded to Neutralize Poison.
	- at level 14, Cure Disease is now upgraded to Heal (essentially, the medic's version of "Lay on Hands").
	- at level 18, can now use Lesser Restoration 3 times per day (no fatigue).
	- All medic cures are touch range, applied instantly, have no vocal component, and are not considered spells for wild/dead magic.
	- The spells are otherwise identical to the existing priest spell at the time of install (i.e. in IWDEE, you can't cast Heal on an undead or elemental).
- Other:
	- IWD Evasion: All "Evades effects from..." messages should now say the name of the spell/ability being evaded.
	- New icon for Hunter Tools, recolored icons for Starjammer spells, changed icons for a few other abilities.
	- Blood Minister: if using Spell Revisions, Madman's Blood no longer causes SR fatigue effects.
	- SCS/ToF: Fixed a few wrong ability icons when this mod was installed after SCS/ToF spell tweaks.
	- Other minor changes.

v4.7.4
- Fixed an issue with haste effects if this mod was installed after SCS/ToF spell tweaks. This affected the Moonlight Knight kit and the Hunter Bone item.
- Fixed a mod conflict (with IWDEE Polymorph fixes mod) that would cause characters to learn Psionic Blast permanently, when using the Milkweed rune.
- Switched some item locations around in BG2EE/IWDEE (main change is making Hunter Bone obtainable earlier).
- Added more shaman bone blades in each game (higher quantities and/or obtainable in more locations).
- Starjammer: Pacifying Field, Jolt, and Revitalizer will now ignore immunities to specific spell levels.
- Grave Warden: Denial will now ignore immunities to specific spell levels. (Note that it will still be blocked by immunity to Necromancy school)
- Aethetic fix with Bubb's Spell Menu: The Denial and Moonlight Vortex abilities will now appear as level 1 spells in the special abilities menu (same as all other abilities from this mod).
- Rearranged item text in tra files for better organization.
- Blood Minister: Right-clicking the Blood abilities in the submenu will now show the description for Blood Transfusion. Previously, only the main Blood Transfusion spell would show the description.

v4.7.3
- Golem Ring: Delayed sound effect on item ability was incorrectly set as undispellable.
- Medic: Adjusted visuals for all abilities + fixed color fade effect on White Remedy (was allowing a save).
- Medic: Remedy abilities will no longer affect undead or golems. Healing Rain will still heal any creature, including in IWD (similar to Mist of Eldath). This is the same restriction that's already on Medical Darts and Shaman Bone Blade. Note that this is intentionally less restrictive than IWD rules.
- IWDEE: Grave Warden's Denial ability will now follow IWD cleric rules for the healing effect. The death ward effect can still be cast on any creature. For creatures immune to healing spells in IWD, Denial will last the full 3 turns, unless dispelled or the summon is killed/unsummoned.
- Shaman Bone Blade: Improved effects structure. Will now always play an audio/visual effect, even for immune creatures. Will now display a string that ability was used. Increased cast range from 1 to 3. Elves and half-elves that fail the save against charm, but make the racial check for charm resistance, will now avoid all effects, instead of being berserked.
- Starjammer: Riftgate balor now has a screen shake effect if summoned. Golem attack range increased from 1 to 2, and attacks can now stun on failed save.
- Other minor adjustments or installer improvements.

v4.7.2
- Maintenance:
	- Temple Knight: Slightly reduced knockback strength of Force + added color fade to affected creatures. Stun duration increased internally (it's still roughly 4 seconds, but after the knockback ends).
	- Moonlight Knight: Fixed an inconsistency in the effects of Moonlight Vortex + added lighting effect on allies (only enemies take damage still).
	- Fixed possible minor dialogue weirdness with a chicken.
	- IWDEE: Grave Warden's Skull Trap was giving Evasion check against the wrong spell resource.
- IWD Evasion notes:
	- Took another look at kit abilities that included Evasion checks for IWDEE. These abilities previously allowed Evasion, and no longer do: Shockwave, Moonlight Vortex, Booming Song. These abilities can (still) be evaded: Incinerate, Electrocannon, Steady Current (secondary targets only), Blasting Song, Dust Explosion (initial blast only), Etherbomb Song.
	- BGEE/BG2EE: If Evasion from IWDification or Talents of Faerun is installed before this mod, then the above abilities will also give a check for Evasion in the BGEE games. (components from ToF that just modify class/kit ability tables are fine to install before this mod)

v4.7.1
- Milkweed (rune): Fixed an issue that would occur if spell components from SCS/ToF were installed after this mod. The CON/WIS drain wasn't being removed right away after battle (it wears off itself eventually).
- Note that recommended install order is still this mod after the spell components, but in case the opposite order is used, Milkweed rune should now be compatible either way.
- Since I was editing this anyways, using a Caryll Rune will no longer instantly remove the stat drain from Milkweed. It gets removed automatically at the same time that the polymorph is reversed.

v4.7
- Maintenance:
	- Fixed Denial/Revitalizer abilities if installed after SCS/ToF revisions to 'cure wounds' spells.
	- IWDEE: item files no longer have description images (fixes visual glitch with Infinity UI++).
	- Standardized and reworked internally how armor restrictions are handled for kits.
	- Improved installer speed.
	- Updated ADD_KIT_EX to v0.6.2.
	- Updated description for Drifter kit to note support for ToF Evasion.
	- Spell selection fix (compatibility section) now links to 'Subtled Spell Tweaks'.
- Adjustments:
	- Starjammer: Riftgate golem is now immune to spells that instakill summons.
	- Starjammer: Riftgate balor will now leave after reloading the area, instead of staying forever.
	- Medic: Healing Rain now heals 3d8+2 per round (increased from 13.5 to 15.5 average).

v4.6
- Fixed abilities for imported multiclass kits (BG2/ToB/SoD):
	- Imported characters will no longer be missing abilities when starting a new game.
	- This issue affected Charname only, though the fix is applied for all characters.
- Alignment changes:
	- Drifter: Can be any non-lawful alignment.
	- Grave Warden: Any non-evil, non-chaotic alignment.
- Nurse kit update:
	- Medical Darts: Now does base 1d4+3 healing/damage, with another +1 every 5 levels.
	- Medical Darts: Increased number of darts given per use from 8 to 10.
	- Medical Darts: Added a hidden +15 THAC0 bonus when targeting allies.
	- Injection Shot: Increased time to make the shot from 2 rounds to 5 rounds.
	- Injection Shot: Feeblemind duration reduced from permanent to 8 hours.
- Crow Hunter update:
	- Visceral Attack: Now gained at levels 9, 13, and 18 (was previously at 11, 15, and 19).
	- Multiclass fix: Imported characters will no longer gain Set Snares, not even if you export/import a CHR repeatedly.
- War Magician update:
	- Unleash Magic: Now also gives a +2 caster level bonus (no longer useless at low levels).
	- Twisted Barricade: At level 10+, this will also deflect single target spells while active.
	- Both abilities are now dispellable.
	- Both abilities are now affected by wild/dead magic zones.
- Compatibility update for DoF mod:
	- Added an additional minor sphere for each Paladin/Ranger kit. This is mainly for QoL. 
	- Every kit will, at minimum, have either "Healing" or "Combat" sphere as a minor sphere.
- Other:
	- Installer improvements.
	- Updated ADD_KIT_EX to v0.6.0.

v4.5
- Medical Darts (Nurse kit):
	- Will no longer inflict bleed on allies if Clawmark rune is used. Enemies can still be affected.
	- Critical hits will deal double healing or poison damage. Target must be vulnerable to crits.
- Other:
	- Installer improvements.
	- Changed BAM icons for holy symbols again.
- Compatibility:
	- Fixed some weirdness when installed before OlvynSpells mod.
	- Note that unlike most kit mods, this mod can be installed before or after OlvynSpells.

v4.4
- Fixes:
	- EET: Fixed an incorrect text string (Injection Shot ability).
	- Confessor: Fixed entangle effect not being dispellable.
	- Shaman Bone Blade: Fixed incorrect weight in description.
	- EE Fixpack: Fixed immunity spell states on items/effects (opcode 328 needs to be set to IWD2 mode).
- Kit changes:
	- Drifter: Can gain IWDEE Evasion if ability is in the game (IWDEE and IWDification versions supported).
	- Nurse: Can now Specialize in ranged weapons.
	- Grave Warden: Becomes immune to fear at level 3 and immune to blindness/gaze attacks at level 8.
	- Confessor: Entangle now ignores magic resist. It still has a saving throw after 3 rounds, and can still be dispelled.
- Ability notes:
	- Spells/items that block death magic will also block Aec'Letec's death gaze in BG1/EET.
	- Reduced casting time: Denial, Moonlight Vortex, Medical Darts.
	- Passive abilities will give a message in the dialogue box when initially gained at level up.
- Compatibility notes:
	- Faiths and Powers beta (v0.85sd20): Improved compatibility. Notably, the paladin kits will be able to select any of the 3 archetypes, whether this mod is installed before or after FnP. Previously, the archetype selection gave an undefined string if this mod was installed after FnP.
	- 5e-casting: Updated compatibility info to say that this mod should be installed before 5e-casting. Spellcasting will work either way, but the Cruciform item needs to be installed before the item update component of 5e-casting.

v4.3
- Main component now has 3 subcomponents:
	- Option 1: Base kits + multiclass variants
	- Option 2: Base kits only
	- Option 3: Misc items only (no kits or Hunter Badges)
- Additional info:
	- If you install kits here, the item pack is still a separate component afterwards.
	- If you install the item pack here, kits cannot be installed later.
- Other:
	- Made it a bit easier to find one of the items (for all games). It's an intentionally hidden item, but you can get it through dialogue now, instead of killing or stealing.
	- Other minor changes.

v4.2
- IWDEE notes:
	- If the Misc items component is installed, an NPC in Kuldahar will now give a hint for where some of the items from this mod become available.
	- Moved a couple items that were in the main game to HoW (including 1 Hunter Badge).
	- Added a Colorless Demon Soul to the main game. So now 2 are obtainable (the other in TotLM).
	- More Shaman Bone Blade locations.
	- Can no longer purchase additional Hunter Badges in HoW (see note below).
- Other:
	- Shaman Bone Blade: Saving throw changed to a Save vs. Polymorph.
	- Adjusted a few item icons.
	- BG1/BG2: Changed location for 1-2 Hunter Badges in each game.
- Note on Hunter Badge availability in Throne of Bhaal or Heart of Winter:
	- This is now a config.ini option, instead of always installed.
	- Enables adding additional Hunter Badges to merchants in ToB or HoW.
	- By default, this is ON for ToB and OFF for HoW.

v4.1
- Added 2 consumable/limited use items:
	- Colorless Demon Soul
	- Shaman Bone Blade
- Adjusted bleeding effects again:
	- Bloodletter (Confessor): 2 damage per round for 6 rounds
	- Splintering Shot (Crow Hunter): 1 damage per round for 1 turn
	- Clawmark (rune): 1d3 damage per round for 4 rounds
- Medic kit changes:
	- Removed restriction: May not wear gauntlets or bracers.
	- Added restriction: May not use bladed weapons, other than short swords or daggers.
- Other:
	- Hunter Bone: AC/saves bonuses no longer stack. Changed BAM images (previous BAM files now used for Shaman Bone Blade).
	- Golem Ring: Added sound effect when Iron Flesh duration ends.

v4.0
- Split install into 2 subcomponents:
	- Option 1: Base kits + multiclass variants
	- Option 2: Base kits only
- New kits:
	- Full Metal Jaguar (fighter)
	- Nurse (thief)
	- Spell Fencer (fighter/mage)
- New multiclass variants:
	- Beast Hunter FC
	- Crow Hunter MT
	- Full Metal Jaguar (FM, FT)
	- Nurse MT
- Fixes:
	- Fixed a possible install error, related to config settings.
	- Spelling fixes.
- Kit updates:
	- Moonlight Knight: Moonlight Vortex will now always do some damage to undead and outerplanar creatures. Magic resist, for these creatures, will halve the damage instead of negating it.
	- Confessor: The saving throw for Rooting Shot was previously checked immediately on-hit. It will now be checked after the initial 3 rounds of entangle. The effects are still the same.
- Other changes:
	- Moved a few item locations.
	- Other minor changes (sounds, icons, kit colors, etc.)
	- Added Config option for Holy Symbols in IWDEE (disabled by default)

v3.3
- New items:
	- Added 5 items to the "Misc items" component. Obtainable in BG2 and IWD/HoW.
	- One of the new items, Jade Feather, enhances the Medic's remedy abilities.
- Kit Changes:
	- Medic: Increased Healing Rain area to 12-ft. radius.
	- Drifter: The first bonus to hit/damage is now gained at level 3, then every 5 levels thereafter.
- Other Changes:
	- Hunter (rune): Added +5 to all thieving skills (in addition to +1 THAC0 bonus)
	- Changed icons for some abilities.

v3.2
- Fixes:
	- Grave Warden: Fixed usability issue (wasn't able to wear Montolio's Cloak in BG2).
	- Drifter: Record screen will no longer show a line for Backstab (just a visual fix).
- Kit changes:
	- Warhound: The first bonus to hit/damage is now gained at level 3, then every 5 levels thereafter (so 3, 8, 13, 18, etc.).
	- Confessor: Increased healing (1d4+1) and reduced bleed duration (8 rounds) for Bloodletter.
	- Medic: Increased healing (2d6) for Black Remedy.
	- Crow Hunter: Reduced bleed duration (6 rounds) for Splintering Shot.
	- Beast Hunter: Revised Hunter Tools. Reduced duration for Quicksilver.
	- Blood Minister: Tweaked/revised all blood types.
- Item changes:
	- Clawmark (rune): Bleed duration reduced from 10 rounds to 4 rounds.
	- Moon (rune): Increased XP bonus from +35 to +65 per kill.
	- Powder Keg Badge: Increased chance of fire damage from 10% to 15%.

v3.1
- Fixes:
	- Drifter: Some enemy entangling effects were getting through.
	- Noble Scion: Wasn't able to use some Paladin items (i.e. Carsomyr).
	- SoD: The crafting abilities for hunter badges couldn't be learned.
- Changes:
	- Drifter: Added more mod spells to immunities lists (MiH spellpack, Deities of Faerun, sod2bg2).
	- Noble Scion: Self-damage from Blood Bullet won't kill the character if falling to 0 HP.
	- Oedon Writhe: Spell restore capped at 6th level spells.
	- Anti-Clockwise Metamorphosis: Movement speed bonus increased from +2 to +4.
- Beamdog items (bonus effects):

	- Stalker Gauntlets: Crow Hunter, Crow Hunter FT, Crow Hunter FMT
- Updated Compatibility info (with FnP mod):
	- I now recommend to install this mod after applying a FnP sphere system. See Compatibility section.
	- Fixed compatibility with FnP beta/v0.85 (Still backwards compatible with v0.84.5).

v3.0
- Fixes:
	- Fixed potential issue with IWDEE (caused by the file #BONECIR.SPL, if it was in the override).
	- Fixed Starjammer's Jolt spell effects when installed with the Deities of Faerun mod.
- Added kits:
	- Drifter (ranger)

	- A couple other minor changes (sounds or BAM images).
- Updated Compatibility section:
	- FnP note: The multiclass Cleric kits are currently not compatible with the beta versions of FnP. Use v0.84.5 if you want to use the multiclass kits with FnP.

v2.8
- What's new:
	- Added 2 Hunter Badges: Saw Hunter Badge and Old Hunter Badge.
	- Added 3 Caryll Runes: Hunter, Moon, and Milkweed.
	- Added Ether Limiter amulet (has bonus effect for Warhound kit).
	- Grave Warden: Can challenge Presio (IWDEE).
- Fixes:
	- Revitalizer: Fixed visual/audio effects not showing if the target was higher level than the caster.
- Changes:
	- Revised Jolt spell: Still raises dead, but also breaks curses and cures several status effects.
	- Changed a couple item locations to account for new items.
	- Calamity Ring: Added to expansion areas (SoD, ToB, HoW) if not already obtained.
	- Crowfeather Cloak: Added non-detection.
	- Cruciform: Will also give 2 bonus 2nd-level priest spell slots.

v2.7
- Fixes:
	- Beast Hunter (multiclass): Wasn't able to equip the "Big Metal Unit" armor (usable by every class/kit).
	- Grave Warden: Fixed potential usability issue on non-English installs of BG2EE.
	- Improved the way mass patching of spells/items by certain kits is handled.
	- A few other minor adjustments to install files.
- Changes:
	- Cosmic Watcher badge: Saving throw against the level drain is now made at a -2 penalty.
	- SoD: Changed one of the item locations.
	- Added a bag of holding, containing items from this mod (d2#hbag.ITM). Not obtainable from normal gameplay.

v2.6
- Improved icons for Caryll runes. The differences should be easier to see.
- Adjusted timings of a couple visual effects.
- Cleaned up some of the abilities tables (no gameplay effect)
- Some installer improvements.
- Updated some of my old functions files.

v2.5
- Added French translation, provided by 11jo.

v2.4
- IWDEE: Radiant Sword Badge now gives charm immunity (as per Protection From Evil in IWD)
- Confessor: Rooting Shot sets movement to 0 for the entangle. Previously, this could be broken by applying another movement effect. This is fixed. The entangled status can still be dispelled or removed by Free Action.
- Starjammer: More tweaks to Starjammer creature scripts (golem, gibberlings, balor)
- Renamed a few files for better organization (ability/item files are unchanged)
- Minor text edits (nothing important, I just make small edits sometimes)

v2.3
- Updated Compatibility section with info on the FnP multiclass mod.
- Kits are now selectable by any race if the base class is selectable. I made this change because there are some mods that enable all classes for all races, but don't enable all kits as well.
- The multiclass Cleric kits will now gain holy symbols at around 4 million xp (BG2 only):
	- Beast Hunter (FMC) gains it at Cleric level 14.
	- Moonlight Knight (CR) gains it at Cleric level 17.
	- This is compatible with any other mods or sphere system changes.
- Deities of Faerun: 
	- Revised spheres for most kits.
	- Multiclass clerics weren't gaining holy symbols, even at Cleric level 25. This is fixed (using above levels).
- Faiths & Powers: 
	- Revised spheres for multiclass clerics. 
	- My multiclasses don't require the FnP multiclass mod for compatibility with FnP.
	- I'd recommend installing this mod AFTER FnP multiclass, if using it. More info in Compatibility section.
- 5e casting mod: This mod can now be installed before or after 5e casting.

v2.2
- BGEE:
	- Status immunities should now block the correct display strings (they were only blocking the right strings in BG2). I went through abilities in each game to find the strings needed for each immunity. I still block a few "incorrect" strings in case some are used by other mods (they have the correct text, just not used by the game).
- IWDEE:
	- Healing Blood will cure poison now, rather than just slowing the damage. It was already working properly in the BG games. This mistake was made because I clone Slow Poison into a subspell, but forgot that it doesn't fully cure poison in IWD.
	- Status immunities should now block the correct display strings.
- Riftgate balor:
	- No longer immune to critical hits.
	- Summons Aerial Servants instead of a Fallen Planetar.
	- Changed some of the scripted spells.
	- Increased cooldown time for some script actions.
	- Can now re-summon creatures indefinitely (on a timed delay).
- Ether Booster (casting speed penalty):
	- Made it so the kit abilities from this mod are not affected by casting speed penalties (non-spell abilities shouldn't be affected anyways). Exceptions are Denial, Moonlight Vortex, and Bolt of Glory.
	- The Misc items component will also patch base game kit/NPC abilities and non-caster HLAs. Spell-like abilities, such as Shadowstep or Paladin abilities, are not patched.
- Golem Ring (haste/slow immunity):
	- In previous versions, simply equipping the ring would remove any haste or slow effects. At the same time, the Iron Flesh ability didn't give immunity to haste/slow, so you could cast it, then switch the ring out for a different one.
	- I changed it so that equipping the ring won't remove any effects. It will just prevent future effects while equipped. Using Iron Flesh, however, will now remove any haste or slow effects, as well as make the character immune to both for the duration.
- Beast's Embrace: Added effect to account for an EE Fixpack change.
- Cruciform: Changed portrait icon to the standard "Regenerating" one used by other items/spells.
- Blood Transfusions: Added additional portrait icons ("Protection From Poison", etc.).
- Corruption rune: Will now show a "Regenerating" icon, but only when under 50% HP.
- Some other minor adjustments.

v2.1
- Config.ini: Added proficiencies option for multiclass Clerics. If enabled, can place slots in all weapon types. This does not change usability by itself. This option is for use with tweaks that enable all weapons for Clerics. Note that this is automatically enabled if this mod is installed after Deities of Faerun or the Faiths and Powers usability component.
- Rearranged order that kits are installed (Arcane kits moved to top).
- Moonlight Knight (C/R): It was able to place slots in all weapon types by default, even though Cleric/Rangers are normally restricted to Cleric weapons. This is fixed.
- Ether Booster: Bonus effect is applied immediately when Unleash Magic is used. The effect is applied every 3 seconds, but previously you had to wait 3 seconds for it to start.
- Cruciform: Bonus effect is applied immediately when Bloodletter is used.
- Hunter Badges: Bonus effects are applied immediately when Fire Weapon is used.

v2.0
New additions
- Added 6 multiclass variants:
	- Beast Hunter (f/m)
	- Beast Hunter (f/m/c)
	- Warhound (f/m)
	- Moonlight Knight (c/r)
	- Crow Hunter (f/t)
	- Crow Hunter (f/m/t)
- These are installed together with the single classes. As with the single class, each kit can be enabled or disabled from the config.ini file.
- Added 9 Caryll Runes to Misc items component. These are items with party-wide effects, inspired by the similarly named items from Bloodborne. See GitHub page or forum posts for more details.

Fixes/Tweaks:
- Blood Minister
	- DoF sphere system: Added weapon restrictions (blunt, crossbows, small piercing weapons). These are implemented the same way as Raduziel's own kits (added directly to weapon files). This kit also wasn't getting "All" spheres up to 7th level. This is fixed.
	- FnP sphere system: Will now gain higher level healing spells, in addition to previous spheres.
- Frenzying Flame: Added audio while the spell is active
- Craft Hunter Badge: Added info about using the ability when right-clicking the icon
- Fixed WeiDU error when installing after FnP.
- Fixed proficiencies for Paladin and Ranger kits when installed after FnP.
- Updated ADD_KIT_EX to v0.5.1


v1.5
- Starjammer: Minimum stats changed to be different from Dragon Disciple

v1.4
- Added spell cap option to config.ini: This affects 2 spells, Electrocannon and Revitalizer (Starjammer kit). The cap can be set to level 20, 30, 40, or 50. Any other number will revert to the defaults (20 for BG games and 30 for IWDEE).
- More edits to the Riftgate balor (both buffs and nerfs). If you're unprepared for it, best thing to do would be to run to a different map (it will search you out if on the same map). It's also vulnerable to Imprisonment, if you can get the spell off.
- Added 2 items to the "Misc items" component:
	- Stone Ring
	- Flynn's Ring
- Golem Ring ability now says "Iron Flesh" by the portrait icon to differentiate from Stoneskin.
- Might have made a few other minor adjustments.

v1.3
- Powder Keg: Fixed minor issue when installed after Rogue Rebalancing. The kit was starting with the RR song, though you could switch right away to Blasting Song. Now the kit starts with Blasting Song set as the Bard Song.

v1.2
- One item in SoD was gained without charges. This is fixed.
- Revised the balor script (Riftgate enemy). It has more spell variety, but also doesn't use annoying spells like Death Spell or Remove Magic as often. It no longer starts with Protection From Magical Weapons, but it has a couple summons instead. The phase 2 and phase 3 buffs also happen earlier.
- Also made minor edits to the golem and gibberling scripts.

v1.1
- Added Cosmic Watcher Badge to BG2 and IWD main campaigns (they were already in the expansions). Both are very late game.
- Adjusted location of one of the other badges in BG2.
