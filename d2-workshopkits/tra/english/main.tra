(Alteration)

Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When Riftstep is cast, a portal opens up in front of the caster, who immediately steps through it. The character may move freely within the rift for 7 seconds while others are frozen in time, but cannot attack, cast spells, or use any items or abilities. After 7 seconds, another portal opens up and the caster steps out of the rift.

A rift should be handled with caution. When this spell is cast, there is a 5% chance to attract the attention of 5 Space Gibberlings, who will savagely attack the caster and <PRO_HISHER> companions.~

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn

Area of Effect: 20-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

A Pacifying Field covers a 20-ft. radius, centered on the caster. All creatures within the area at the time of casting, whether ally, enemy, or neutral, are enclosed by a protective Sanctuary for one turn. Creatures under a Sanctuary cannot be directly targeted by spells or attacks. There is no Saving Throw and the spell ignores Magic Resistance.

A sanctuaried creature can move around or cast non-attack spells without breaking the spell. Any combat actions, for example, casting a Fireball, a True Sight, or a summoning spell, will remove the Sanctuary.~

(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 8
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster opens a rift in spacetime to a place far beyond the stars. After a moment, a Juggernaut Golem emerges from the rift. The golem stays for 1 turn and will obey the caster as long as it remains summoned. Due to the energy exerted in the summoning process, the caster must wait 1 turn between each use of this spell.

A rift should be handled with caution. When this spell is cast, there is a 2% chance to attract the attention of a balor, who will destroy the golem and exit the rift in its place, intent only on tearing the caster and <PRO_HISHER> companions apart piece by piece. A Protection From Evil spell will not make the fiend ignore the party.~
